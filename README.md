# macOS Build Scripts

A collection of scripts used to build macOS installers. Scripts can be run individually with Terminal or put into a build system like Jenkins and run as pipelines.

### Dependencies:
* AutoDMG
* munkipkg
* vfuse

### Notes:
These scripts may need to be edited to run in your environment ... check paths to make sure they are relevant for you. All scripts were tested on macOS 10.13
